# Appendix 
## Opportunities for Potential Improvement:

- [AWS IAM user bulk key rotation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/patterns/automatically-rotate-iam-user-access-keys-at-scale-with-aws-organizations-and-aws-secrets-manager.html)

- [Identify unused IAM roles with AWS Config](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/continuously-monitor-unused-iam-roles-aws-config/) and remove regularly

- [Identify unnecessary permissions on other resources](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/automate-analyzing-permissions-using-iam-access-advisor/) and review regularly

- Privilege Access Management (CyberArk PAM) for machine-level access control

- Assess security measures in place against [OWASP Principles of Security](https://owasp.org/www-project-developer-guide/draft/04-foundations/03-security-principles)
- Assess design against Baseline Security Assessment on [AWS](https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/guidance-for-baseline-security-assessment-on-aws)
- Identify attack vector (if any) with reference to [OWASP Top Ten](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/), [SANS Top 25](https://www.sans.org/top25-software-errors) and [OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (AVAS) Level 3](https://github.com/OWASP/ASVS)
- Prioritize threat in team discussion with reference to [OWASP Risk Rating](https://owasp.org/www-community/OWASP_Risk_Rating_Methodology) and business & technical context

## Interesting Tools
- [Threagile](https://threagile.io/)Threat Modelling diagrams and report generator
- [PenTestGPT](https://github.com/GreyDGL/PentestGPT) â€“ an interactive Pentest tool (identification) support any LLMs

## Interesting Stats
- Data breach = [Loss of $180 per record with PII](https://purplesec.us/resources/cyber-security-statistics/)
